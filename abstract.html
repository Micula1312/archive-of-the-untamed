# Archive of the Untamed :: abstract

> Archive of the Untamed is an artistic research project investigating
> the defense of landscape and public space as zones of conflict and potential.

> The contact with the urban forest Prati di Caprara (Bologna) and the
> artistic collective EXIT initiated a reflection on the archive as a
> counter-narrative and political device. Developed on-site alongside the
> local committee "Rigenerazione No Speculazione", the process aims to
> co-construct an archive of urban wildness.

> Wildness becomes a generative concept: a disordered, resistant force
> that escapes normalization and generates alternative visions of territory.

> The online platform https://thearchiveoftheuntamed.xyz/ collects
> heterogeneous materials to map wildness and interconnect actors engaged
> with urban forests through artistic and political practices.

> From the installative dimension emerges the high-tech treehouse,
> a prototype for vertical occupation inspired by the occupation of Don Bosco Park
> in Bolognaâ€”a concrete practice of reclaiming urban space.

> The project also takes a performative turn as the artist traverses the forest
> as an emotional and sensorial space, activating a direct and subjective
> relation with the environment, testing the habitat prototype in person.

> Final output: the exhibition '6Artista' collects the reflections surfaced
> during the process and reactivates them within the space of Pastificio Cerere.
> The editorial publication documents the rhizomatic and nonlinear development
> of the project through its multimedia traces and connections to external spaces.
