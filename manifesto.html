# ARCHIVE OF THE UNTAMED :: MANIFESTO

> This is not an archive of the past.
> This is not a neutral repository.

> It is a living system:
  made of gestures, roots, soil, and stories.

> An interface between body and environment,
  between resistance and memory.

> It archives what escapes,
  what overgrows,
  what exceeds the protocols of control.

> The wild is not the other.
> It is the force that resists capture,
  that grows in the cracks of domination.

> Archive of the Untamed is a tool for:
  - imagining otherwise,
  - reclaiming space,
  - documenting the unarchivable.
